Introduction
=============
In the lecture if we covered some basic theory of electromagnetic waves including the damped and undamped wave equations. These derivations are extensively covered in textbooks and tutorials such as in Jol et al. (Principles of GPR available online via the library) or also in the `Sensors and Software GPR manual <https://geolportal.sdsu.edu/jiracek/sage/documents/Sensors%20and%20Software%20GPR%20Manual.pdf>`_ . 

Below are our own examples of standard processing steps required for ground-penetrating radar analysis. The intention is to be educational, and not to replace existing GPR processors such as `ImpDAR <https://impdar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. The dataset under consideration was collected during a field excursion to the Italian Appenines in summer 2023.
