Welcome to Advanced Geophysics 2023's documentation!
====================================================
This is a rough documentation for the lecture "Advanced Geophysics" held at the University of TÃ¼bingen in 2023. It is not complete, particularily theoretical parts discussed on the blackboard are not necessarily included here. It mostly serves as an archive for the signal processing part of the lecture.
